## üìö Notebooks Overview

### Linear Regression

- **Linear_Regression_Normal_Equation.ipynb**  
  This notebook demonstrates how to implement linear regression using the normal equation, providing an efficient closed-form solution to the linear regression problem.

- **Linear_Regression_Gradient_Descent.ipynb**  
  This notebook covers the implementation of linear regression using gradient descent optimization, including both batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent methods.

### Gradient Descent

- **Batch_Gradient_Descent.ipynb**  
  This notebook explores batch gradient descent, an optimization technique used to minimize the cost function of a linear model by updating the parameters based on the entire dataset in each iteration.

- **Stochastic_Gradient_Descent.ipynb**  
  This notebook demonstrates stochastic gradient descent, where the parameters are updated using one training example at a time, offering faster convergence, especially for large datasets.

- **Mini_batch_Gradient_Descent.ipynb**  
  This notebook explains mini-batch gradient descent, a compromise between batch and stochastic gradient descent, which uses a subset of the data for each iteration, balancing speed and accuracy.

### Polynomial Regression

- **Polynomial_Regression.ipynb**  
  This notebook covers polynomial regression, showcasing the use of higher-degree polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships. It also discusses regularized models such as Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

### Classification

- **Classification.ipynb**  
  This notebook covers the implementation of binary and multiclass classification using various models such as logistic regression and random forest. It also explores model performance evaluation through metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, and error analysis using confusion matrix. Multilabel and multi-output classification are also explored.
